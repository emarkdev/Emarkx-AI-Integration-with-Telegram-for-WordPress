**Our Plugin relies on 3rd Party as a service**
Emarkx AI Integration with Telegram plugin relies on a third-party service, which is OpenAI's language model, hosted at openai.com. This service is essential for the functionality of the plugin. The plugin connects to OpenAI's language model and has an additional function to intercept messages from a Telegram bot and send them to OpenAI for processing. It also receives the processed generated responses from OpenAI and forwards them to specific Telegram chat ID's.

You can find more information about the third-party service, OpenAI, by visiting their website at openai.com. To understand the terms of use for OpenAI's service, please refer to their terms of use page at openai.com/terms.
